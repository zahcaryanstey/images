<h1> How to run the code </h1>
<p> 1) Download files from data set google drive https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zWpYBk_dP0pgo5ZlORNoXHXFwG4zGbc8 </p>
<p> 2) In the csv files go to the dataset that you desire  </p>
<p> 3) In the files for the data set download the train, test and csv files <p>
<p> 4) Now go to the Images folder in the google drive </p>
<p> 5) Click on the dataset that you want and go to the all file </p>
<p> 6) Within the all file download the images in the Ch1, Ch7 and Ch11 folders </p>
<p> 7) Now on this git hub download the ALL_Channels.py file as well as the DataLoader_All_Channels.py file  making sure to save them in the same dircetory.</p>
<p> 8) within the ALL_Channels.py you want to change the paths in lines 44 - 49 to the paths to the path were you have saved the csv file, Ch1 images, Ch7 images, Ch11 images, and training and testing csv files. </p>
<p> 9) In lines 246 and 264 you want to change the paths to where ever you want the images to save </p>
<p> 10) In line 272 you also want to change the path to where ever you want the model parameters to save </p>
<p> 11) Now you should be able to run the code </p>
