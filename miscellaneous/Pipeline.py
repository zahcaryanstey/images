# Training pipeline

"""
Algorithm for training pipeline
1) import libaries
2) Load data
3) Visualize a few images
4) train the model
5) visualize the model predicions
6) fine tune the convenutional network
7) train and evaluate
8) convnet as fixed feature extractor
9) train and evaluate
"""

"""
WHAT WE NEED 
1) Load cell images from data loader 
2) Define a convolutional neural network
3) Define a loss function
4) Define a optimizer 
5) Train the network on the training data 
6) Validation 
7) Test the network on the test data (last thing to do )
